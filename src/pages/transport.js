            If you have a non-compliant car, it will cost £12.50, which covers
            from midnight until midnight (24 hours). If you're in the area
            beyond midnight, you'll have to pay for a second day.

            Alternatively, you can park outside the ULEZ and car share to cut
            down on costs (and petrol / diesel).

            Unfortunately there isn't a lot of parking space at The Woodman, and
            we ask that you don't try to park in their car park. There is free
            parking down the nearby side roads.

            Alternatively, there is a car park near Eastcote station, which is
            either a short walk away, or you can get the 282 bus which will take
            you to directly outside The Woodman.

            If you are arriving by public transport, Eastcote station is on the
            Uxbridge branch of the Metropolitan line, followed by the 282 bus to
            take you to The Woodman.

            The Woodman's postcode is HA5 2PR, and bear in mind that it will be
            a Sunday, so some public transport may end early.
