    "description": "The Bedlam Institute ran for over 75 years, harbouring those thought mentally unstable to be members of society. Opening first in the late 1800s as a refuge for people who needed help, it soon turned into something far more sinister as the doctors began to perform horrifying experiments and tests on some of the patients. Many of the early patients died as a result of the testing, with them disappeared the majority of the records for the patients in what was to become a large scale cover up by those in charge at the institute. In the early 1900s things began to change in society and it became harder for the doctors to continue to cover up their fowl experiments, so they began to operate in secret, continuing their work but under a guise of progressive and new experimental treatments. Most of the records that were kept on patients were either fabricated or simply destroyed, making it almost impossible to track what was actually performed on the unfortunate souls who were admitted to the asylum. Fast forward 50 years to the admittance of Annie Sanbrooke, a poor young lady admitted to Bedlam under false pretences, it was clear from the start that she planned to escape… What happened to her while she was in the institute did she ever escape? You and your party have been sent to discover what happened to Annie and find your own freedom from one of the most evil places imaginable… Nothing is certain, you’re not sure how you got there and there’s an eerie feeling the place is long since abandoned.",

Order has begun to break down and chaos is threatening to erupt – fuelled by the rumours that the fire was started on purpose… Londoners are blaming every stranger that crosses their path. Is it another attack in the long running feud with the Catholics? A retaliation in the war with the Dutch? Or was it just an accident? Only one man knows the truth about how the fire started, and that man is Thomas Farriner, a baker from Pudding Lane, from whose bakery the first flames appeared on September 2nd… But with his house and, in fact, his entire street long destroyed, Farriner and his three children have fled to safety at the house of his brother David, on Mincing Lane. Meanwhile, a Frenchman by the name of Robert Hubert has been arrested on suspicion of starting the fire. If found guilty, he will hang, and although he doesn’t seem in his right mind, and his story doesn’t add up, the authorities want someone to blame and are ignoring their suspicions that he is innocent. In order to set things straight and stop London collapsing into paranoid anarchy, Thomas Farriner must be convinced to deliver a statement describing what really happened on the night of September 2nd through the door of the nearest church. But first, someone must brave the fiery streets and dastardly challenges in order to find him… The question then is, what will he decide to say? The fate of London awaits…",

    "description": "Your mission “Botanist Manor” will take you to Kirkwall, Scotland, in the Orkney Islands. In 80 minutes, you will have to infiltrate a mysterious escape game called “TimeGates”, owned by the eccentric Ewan McAllister, in order to find Sarah Fisher, a famous journalist who disappeared a week ago. Sarah Fisher, an investigative journalist from the Herald Scotland, disappeared without a trace a week ago near Blair Manor. This historic site has now been transformed into an escape game centre, called “TimeGates”. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to use the time machine to go back in time to the town of Kirkwall. Once there, you will have to infiltrate this escape game by posing as ordinary customers and attempt to save the journalist before it’s too late.",

    "review": "Oh my, where do we even start with Botanist Manor? Firstly, as it's a room with a minimum of 3 players, we brought Conor's brother with us for this room. We were the first room of the day. Given the overall theme of Escape Rush is that they are a secret spy agency, it made so much sense that they didn't have a big shop front. In fact, the only sign that they were even there was a small sign that stated the name of the spy agency, Ravenswood. Upon meeting our GM, we were asked if we were there to buy a suit. We took far too long to catch on, so he very helpfully reminded us that we'd booked for a floral suit fitting, as we're BOTANISTS. He led us through the door, past some elaborate shop fronts, into one that looked exactly like a London tailer's shop. It felt like we were on the set of Kingsman (if you haven't seen that film, we recommend it). We were then given a briefing, in a secret agent briefing room, before beginning the room. The story is a little complex, with you being people doing an escape room, pretending to be secret agents going back in time, to do an escape room, to solve a disappearance. As always, we won't give spoilers in this review, but just know that the word 'stunning' doesn't even begin to cover how well-themed this room was. The whole thing felt like being in a movie, with some incredible moments that we still can't stop talking about. This was truly an escape experience, rather than an escape room. While there weren't lots of puzzles, Botanist Manor is one that we would recommend as a must-do room."

    "review": "With a theme of an AI assistant gone wrong, we weren't really sure what to expect. It was our first visit to the Guildford branch of Paradox Parlours, and our first time meeting Kieran, our GM. While the theming wasn't that special (it was themed to a living room, but it was fairly basic), the communications with the AI assistant (played by Kieran) were hilarious! It started with polite comments, before evolving through sassy remarks, joking with us (and at our expense), and finally ending up singing over us trying to share puzzle answers. The room itself wasn't anything special, but this room was absolutely worth it for the AI assistant! Top marks to Kieran, who also gave us a wonderful debrief after, along with a fairly long chat about escape rooms and theme parks."

    "review": "Upon entering, our GM (Charlie) greeted us in character. He asked us to take a seat at the large, beautiful wooden table in the center of the room, and gestured to the cells that were directly in front of us. He informed us that we would be chained up in the brig for our crimes. He started by giving us nicknames (Abi was Brains, as the brains of the operation, and Conor was Muscles, because he's the strong one), before chaining us up (with soft, easy-release velcro cuffs) in separate cells, and leaving us to work out our escape. The executioner came to visit at points during the room, and we had to pretend to still be chained up if we'd managed to get our cuffs off (following the game machanics, not just by removing them ourselves). If we needed it, he gave us cryptic clues, and it was such an immersive way of providing hints. Once we got over the fact that anyone walking past the shop front could see us, we quickly were immersed, and we absolutely loved the variety of puzzles. A fantastic room, an enthusiastic and lovely GM, and a wonderful experience."

You could choose Standard (for players who have played 5 or less escape rooms, up to 10 clues), Advanced (for players who have played more than 5 escape rooms, up to 5 clues), or Genius (for players who have played more than 50 escape rooms, up to 3 clues). We chose Advanced, as while we've done more than 50 escape rooms, we're only a team of two. This difficulty level determines which manual you are given. After a video briefing, we were directed to the room by our GM. Unfortunately, the puzzles in this room felt very disjointed. Once you find the manual, the rest of the room was a confusing mess of looking at the manual and trying to find a thing that looked like it matches what's in the manual. We weren't given many hints, until the final 3 minutes, when suddenly we were bombarded with so many clues that we couldn't make use of them all. One item that we needed to find was hidden high up, above head height, so Abi (who's 5 foot 6 inches tall) couldn't see it, even after our GM pointed it out to us. In the end, we weren't successful, being two puzzles away from escaping. We felt a little let down by this room - we don't mind not escaping if we've had a good time, but it was more stressful than enjoyable."

Our GM, Agent David, was in character from the moment we stepped foot through their doors. In fact, we were involved in the story before we arrived, being directed to a secret entrance via instructions in our confirmation email. We were given time to explore their museum (with most items being hand-made), before the room began. For this room, we won't tell you anything specific - you need to experience it! It felt more akin to the escape experiences that are more common in Europe, and the story was told beautifully. This room immediately became one of our favourite rooms, to the point that we actually bought merch! Marvo Induction is definitely a must-do room in the UK, and it's worth a visit, no matter how long the journey is to get there."

We'd been putting it off a little due to the conflicting reviews - some saying it's really good, others saying it wasn't being well-maintained. Our GM, George, was friendly and welcoming, and he led us down to the basement for the start of this room. The main room was themed pretty well, feeling like a graffiti'd alley. However, the reviews were right. The puzzles themselves were good, although nothing special. One of the puzzles was difficult to complete as some paint had worn away. It also relied on colour a lot, which was difficult due to Conor being colour blind. The entire room had a mild damp smell, and when we entered the final room, we could see light patches of mold all over one of the walls. Such a shame, it felt like this room was once fantastic, but hasn't been cared for as much as it should have been."

This Chapter is set in 1914, and you're started in the trenches of World War One. It's worth noting here that this first room is a little narrow, so going past each other was tricky, even with just two of us in the room. We enjoyed this room, although we did have a few moments of standing around wondering what we were missing in order to progress. There's also one puzzle that's difficult (but not impossible) with only two people. While it is part 2 of a multi-part escape room series, it could definitely be done as a standalone room."
