Having gained his trust by helping him \"acquire\" items over the years, you have access to areas of his home and knowledge of his security that no-one else does. You've been paid well for your services over the years, but you've always felt that an item of the importance of the Holy Grail should be on display for everyone.

    "description": "The Bedlam Institute ran for over 75 years, harbouring those thought mentally unstable to be members of society. Opening first in the late 1800s as a refuge for people who needed help, it soon turned into something far more sinister as the doctors began to perform horrifying experiments and tests on some of the patients. Many of the early patients died as a result of the testing, with them disappeared the majority of the records for the patients in what was to become a large scale cover up by those in charge at the institute. In the early 1900s things began to change in society and it became harder for the doctors to continue to cover up their fowl experiments, so they began to operate in secret, continuing their work but under a guise of progressive and new experimental treatments. Most of the records that were kept on patients were either fabricated or simply destroyed, making it almost impossible to track what was actually performed on the unfortunate souls who were admitted to the asylum. Fast forward 50 years to the admittance of Annie Sanbrooke, a poor young lady admitted to Bedlam under false pretences, it was clear from the start that she planned to escape… What happened to her while she was in the institute did she ever escape? You and your party have been sent to discover what happened to Annie and find your own freedom from one of the most evil places imaginable… Nothing is certain, you’re not sure how you got there and there’s an eerie feeling the place is long since abandoned.",

Order has begun to break down and chaos is threatening to erupt – fuelled by the rumours that the fire was started on purpose… Londoners are blaming every stranger that crosses their path. Is it another attack in the long running feud with the Catholics? A retaliation in the war with the Dutch? Or was it just an accident? Only one man knows the truth about how the fire started, and that man is Thomas Farriner, a baker from Pudding Lane, from whose bakery the first flames appeared on September 2nd… But with his house and, in fact, his entire street long destroyed, Farriner and his three children have fled to safety at the house of his brother David, on Mincing Lane. Meanwhile, a Frenchman by the name of Robert Hubert has been arrested on suspicion of starting the fire. If found guilty, he will hang, and although he doesn’t seem in his right mind, and his story doesn’t add up, the authorities want someone to blame and are ignoring their suspicions that he is innocent. In order to set things straight and stop London collapsing into paranoid anarchy, Thomas Farriner must be convinced to deliver a statement describing what really happened on the night of September 2nd through the door of the nearest church. But first, someone must brave the fiery streets and dastardly challenges in order to find him… The question then is, what will he decide to say? The fate of London awaits…",

    "description": "You are the assistants of a well-known scientist and you have the honour to be the first to test his newest invention. It is called the Time Machine. However, as it often happens with new things, something went wrong. And you've ended up in an a parallel world, the world of Steampunk. The question is - will you be able to get back? Steampunk is a world free from digital gimmicks and internal combustion engines. In this world everything is analog, built on the mechanisms powered by steam. It is a magical universe inspired by the novels of Jules Verne and Herbert Wells with magnificent victorian era interiors and electricity experiments of Nikola Tesla. ",

    "description": "In the dimly lit back alleys of the bustling city, chaos ensues as Don Banano, the larger-than-life mob boss, finds himself in a pickle when his prized fortune is stolen... pointing the finger at none other than Marv the Monkey from the local circus, Banano threatens to rain on everyone's parade by shutting down the beloved spectacle unless his fortune magically reappears. But fear not, for you, the unlikely hero, are thrust into this wacky whirlwind of mayhem. Your mission, should you choose to accept it (and you kinda have to), is a madcap medley of mischief. You must venture into the zany world of Marv's Circus, and try to wrangle Marv himself, retrieve the fortune, and maybe even unmask the real culprit... Armed with nothing but your wits you embark on a bizzare escapade where every wrong turn leads to another hilarious hijink. With Don Banano hot on your trail and the clock ticking like a time bomb made of rubber chickens, you must channel your inner circus clown and save the day before the big top comes crashing down. So grab your popcorn and hold onto your seat, because this circus caper is about to get wilder than a barrel of monkeys on roller skates!",

You’ve received intel that your long-time rivals, the Turd Burglars, are holed up in a secret underground bathroom bunker beneath an abandoned sewage treatment facility. Within their stink-laden lair lies the ultimate prize: the Golden Plunger, said to grant supreme control over all restroom realms. And not just that—scattered throughout the hideout are the legendary Golden Turds, rare relics of mythical toilet lore. Your mission? Infiltrate their hideout, solve their elaborate traps and puzzles, steal the Golden Plunger, and collect as many Golden Turds as you can before the Turd Burglars return from their tactical porta-potty conference. You have 60 minutes. The flush is ticking.",
